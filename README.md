- This is a RESTful API which operates on the user information.

- Used Flask (Python) for developing the endpoints and SQLite as the database.

- Supports GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE operations, thereby can be used in CRUD apps.

- Added API authorization to validate the credentials before using any HTTP operations.

- Used Postman to test the API and site endpoints along with authorization checks.
